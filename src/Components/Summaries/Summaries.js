                Terra Branford (also known as Tina in the original Japanese version) is considered by many to be the main protagonist of Final Fantasy VI. When the story begins, she is little more than a nameless puppet, stripped of her free will by the Gestahlian Empire because of her mysterious ability to use magic.

                <p>
                When Terra is finally freed of the Empire's control, she is afflicted with amnesia, and her emotions are somewhat dulled. This leaves her confused not only about her origins, but by her capacity to feel anything at all -- particularly love.

In the GBA translation (also used in subsequent releases), which is more faithful to the original, he is convinced to join the rebellion because the Empire has been bad for his business. Setzer has a happy-go-lucky attitude, and is likable upfront, but haunted by past losses from which he distracts himself by gambling.

                Emperor Gestahl is the dictator of the Gestahlian Empire in Final Fantasy VI, and at first appears to be the game's primary antagonist.
                </p>
                <p>
                Gestahl's ambition is to project power over the world and use technology to make his empire grow unparalleled in its military branch. Gestahl is ruthless in attaining his goals, shown in his forceful taking of espers and paying no mind to the experiments done to them. He never shows remorse regarding the ethics of infusing children with magic or using a mind-controlling device.
